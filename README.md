<H1> First project using C++ Qt . First approach to Programming </H1> <br>
“Job Hunt” is a platform which connects employers with jobseekers. In the current world, employment is a basic necessity. So we came up with this idea of creating a desktop application named Job Hunt. The main objective of this desktop application is to provide a proper platform for employers to post jobs and job seekers to get their desired jobs as per their skill. It uses Qt framework along with SQLite for graphical user interface, coding and database management system. We learned “Object Oriented Programming” and “Database Management System” through this project. We also learned how to collaborate  and work together on a project.
